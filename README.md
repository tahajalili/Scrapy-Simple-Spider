# Scrapy-Simple-Spider
Simple spider made by python using Scrapy. It will crawl http://quotes.toscrape.com/ and save all quotes of this web page into a JSON file.


How to use:

1- Its necesary to have scrapy installed on your machine.
I highly recommend you to use Anaconda Open-Source distrubiotion.
You can download Anaconda at : https://www.anaconda.com/download/

after Installing anaconda you can install scrapy with anaconda prompt and use this spider.

I would be glad to recieve any idea: tahajalili@gmail.com
