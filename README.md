# Web Scraping
In this repo, you can find some simple web scrapers written in python using common libraries such as Scrapy and Beautiful-Soup4.


Important Notes:

+ For some projects,its necesary to have scrapy installed on your machine.
I highly recommend you to use Anaconda Open-Source distrubiotion.
You can download Anaconda at : https://www.anaconda.com/download/

+ You should have packages below installed:

⋅⋅⋅requests⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅BeautifulSoup4
⋅⋅⋅html.parser(pre-installed on some versions)
⋅⋅⋅Scrapy⋅⋅

I would be glad to receive any idea: tahajalili@gmail.com
